[HONC](https://honc.dev) is a modular collection of choice technologies for building lightweight, type-safe, edge-enabled data apis that scale seamlessly to their demand.

  ðŸª¿ **[Hono](https://hono.dev)** as an api framework  
  ðŸª¿ **Nameyourdatabase** for maximum flexibility
  ðŸª¿ **[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** as the ORM and migrations manager  
  ðŸª¿ **[Cloudflare](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)** Workers for deployment hosting


> ðŸ“š For more examples and templates, check out the [Awesome Honc](https://github.com/fiberplane/awesome-honc) repository.

## Quickstart

To get started run the following command:

```sh
npm create honc-app@latest
```

You'll be prompted a few simple questions, and then a fresh HONC project will arrive in a new directory on your machine.

### Commands

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Once you've [set up a database](https://docs.honc.dev/stack/databases/), you can generate migrations, apply them, and seed the database: 

```sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

If you're inclined to deploy the app to the wild wild internet, you can do so as follows (requires a Cloudflare account):

```sh
npm run deploy
```
